# Cosmere RPG - Unofficial Extra Content

A simple compendium module which supplements the game with homebrew for the remaining Orders of Knights Radiant, as seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HQTCZEMgtMvkO1uwxvKlsmzLVLwaSVfen5gBqB3a3wc/).
It now also includes interpretations of other preview materials, such as the Shardbearer and Artifabrian specialties.

If my module [Cosmere RPG Workbench](https://github.com/Khunkurisu/cosmere-rpg-workbench) is detected, skills for the radiant paths will be registered through it to avoid conflicts with custom ones added. Otherwise, it will simply register the path skills through the system API.

## Known Issues

- Most abilities don't have their resource cost (focus/investiture) set properly
- Abilities still need their damage set to scale using the new system method
- Some abilities don't roll the proper skill test
- You must use the Warrior and Scholar path items from this module rather than the Playtest Module to make use of the extra content for them.
